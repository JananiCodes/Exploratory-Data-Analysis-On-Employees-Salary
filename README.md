**Employees Monthly salary analysis**

This project performs an in-depth analysis of employee monthly salary data using Python.The primary goal is to explore how salary varies across different factors such as Performance Score, Promotions, Job_Title, Industry, Working Hours, Age, Gender. The analysis includes the exploratory data analysis (EDA) to extract the valuable insights and provide a better understanding of the salary dynamics in the dataset.

**Dataset Overview**

The dataset contains 18 columns and 1,00,000 rows and which is available in Kaggle platform. The data includes various features related to employee demographics, Work history, Performance metrics.

**The key columns include:**
* Age
* Gender
* Department
* Job_Title
* Promotions
* Performance_Score
* Working_Hours
* Sick_days

**Project Workflow**

**1.Tools and Libraries**
* Numpy for numerical operations.
* Pandas for data manipulation and handling.
* Matplotlib/Seaborn for data visualization and plotting.
* Scipy/Statsmodels for statistical analysis and hypothesis testing.

**2.Data Cleaning**
* Checking data types and handling outliers.
* Managing the missing values, dropping the duplicates.

**3.Statistical Analysis**
* Observing the key statistic measures such as min, max, mean, standard deviation and (25th, 50th, 75th) percentiles.

**4.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
* Univariate Analysis : Extracting valuable insights by detecting outliers and examining the data distribution using plots and histograms.
* Bivariate Analysis : Investigating relationships between salary and key variables like performance score, job title, and working hours.
* Multivariate Analysis: Analyzing the combined effect of multiple variables on salary.

**5.Hypothesis Testing**
* Performing the statistical tests such as (ANOVA, Chi-Square) to assess the significant differences in salary based on the key variables like job title, performance score and industry.

**6.Central limit Theorem (CLT)**
* Explanation of CLT in the context of dataset.
